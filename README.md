This repository contains a project that demonstrates the use of FastAPI to create a microservices architecture. The project consists of two microservices: a frontend service that handles user interface and form submissions, and a backend service that processes images and interacts with a database

##Functionality
###Frontend Service
The frontend service is responsible for:

Serving the main HTML page located in the static directory.
Handling form submissions which include text and image files.
Sending the submitted data to the backend service for processing.
